      <p>NYPD crime statistics, released in Oct 2018, suggest that there has been little impact on the number of reported domestic violence incidents, including rape, since the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements gathered traction in October 2017. The attached chart shows that the number of reported rapes which occurred during situations of domestic violence in New York City were higher in September 2018 than they were during the same period last year. However, when we look back over a six month period, these numbers have fluctuated each month since October 2017. This contrasts sharply with the number of reported rapes (in non domestic situations) across the city since October 2017, where a gradual increase in the number of reported rapes can be correlated to the timing of the origins of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements.</p>

      <p>During a press conference on Oct. 3, 2018, Lori Pollock, Chief of Crime Control Strategies at the NYPD, said that September rape numbers, in general, were up from the previous month. Referring specifically to domestic violence rape numbers, she said that prosecutions were being actively sought against perpetrators in possession of a gun or ammunition. “That’s a huge step towards keeping these people in prison and not increasing family violence,” she said.</p>

      <p>The NYPD confirm that rape numbers were, indeed, up to 144 for September 2018, versus 118 for August 2018, a jump of 24 percent. However, Chief Pollock said that 25 of the reported rape cases in September 2018 related to incidents which allegedly occurred prior to 2018, meaning that people who did not report at the time of an alleged incident were now beginning to come foreward and report. The NYPD and Mayor de Blasio concurred that victims of sexual violence may now feel more supported by the global sense of solidarity among women as a result of the spotlight on the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements and as a result, may feel more comfortable to report on historical rapes or other sexually violent incidents from their past.</p>

      <p>While prosecutions against perpetrators who are in possession of a gun or ammunition is welcomed, in other ways, it completely misses a crucial point in relation to domestic violence, which is that perpetrators of domestic violence do not need a gun or ammunition to cause injury. Physical brute force, without any weapon, is more than sufficient to cause serious bodily injury to another person. It can, of course, even cause death. Weapons and ammunition just make that task easier for the perpetrator.</p>

      <h2>New Legislation</h2>

      <p>How can Mayor de Blasio state, as he did on Oct. 3, 2018, that New York continues to be the safest big city in America when it's possible that the majority of felonies are not taking place in the public sphere but behind closed doors and go potentially grossly under-reported or not reported at all?</p>


      <p>What most people fail to recognize when they talk about domestic violence victims is that more often than not, victims cannot easily leave their partners because they have no financial income of their own and therefore, despite the daily risk of harm to themselves and to their children, they feel compelled to stay with their abusers in order to raise the couple’s children. Meanwhile,  the psychological trauma which domestic violence victims have to endure through repeated acts of domestic violence, including repeated rapes, while knowing they cannot leave, lasts a lifetime.</p>


      <p>The success of #MeToo and #TimesUp in the corporate media world, where top level media professionals like Bill O’Reilly, Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer, to name a few, have fallen from grace, led the movements’ members to broaden their focus from incidents of sexual assault and harrassment in the media world to incidents affecting ordinary people who suffer sexual harassment and assault in the workplace on a daily basis, but who do not have the voice or the resources to fight their harassers. The #TimesUp legal defense fund was specifically created to help those who could not afford to take their cases to the courts to do just that.</p>

      <p>However, as confirmed by Lindsey Pratt, a psychotherapist who specializes in sexual assault trauma, even with financial resources, it is still never easy for victims of sexual assault to proceed with prosecutions and it is particularly difficult to do so when the sexual abuse is being perpetrated by members of the same family or by those living within the same domestic arrangement as the victim.</p>


      <p>The process for reporting such crimes to police is further hampered by the fact that the majority of police officers serving in the Special Victims Unit are men. Up until recently, NYPD officers and detectives had not necessarily been equipped to handle and process in a compassionate manner, reports by sexual assault victims. Pratt spoke of victims who have described stories of being seated while police officers stood or leaned over them while processing their cases, a stance which she says is uncomfortable and triggering for victims.</p>


      <p>On Oct. 31, New York City Council voted on a package of legislation aimed at improving the New York City Police Department’s handling of sexual assault and harassment victims' cases. The package includes sensitivity training for officers to help them deal with differences in culture, gender expression and sexual orientation and requires reports on staffing levels in the NYPD Special Victims Division. It is hoped that this move may improve the process of reporting for potential sexual assault victims and encourage them to come forward and report any and all potential incidents in a timely manner.</p>


      <p>U.S. veterans are hailed as heroes when they return from war-torn countries. Americans wouldn’t ever dream of disrespecting them. Indeed, extraordinary amounts of time, funds and energy is directed at the process of rehabilitation for returning vets due to the broadly-recognized acceptance that they have survived probably the most terrifying ordeals of their lives, and are therefore in need of the nation's support in treating post-traumatic stress disorder. Terrorism is defined as the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

      But victims of domestic violence are potentially subjected to the unlawful use of violence and intimidation on a daily basis, even without any political aim, and within the confines of what is supposed to be the safety of their own home. Why then are Americans not equally as concerned for victims of domestic violence as they are for war veterans? Veterans come home from wars, if they get out alive. Four of the twenty-seven murders reported in September 2018 by the NYPD related to domestic violence. For some, there will never be an escape from domestic terrorism without the active intervention of the state.</p>

      <p>Chief Pollock confirmed that anyone who is affected by domestic violence or who knows of someone who is subjected to domestic violence can contact the NYPD discreetly on the following number:
