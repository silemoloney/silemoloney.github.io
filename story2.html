      <p>NYPD crime statistics suggest that it’s difficult to approved if the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements have had any significant impact on reported domestic violence incidents, including rape, in the last year. The attached chart shows that while reported rapes in situations of domestic violence in New York City are higher in September 2018 than they were during the same period last year, the numbers have fluctuated each month since October 2017. This trend, or lack thereof, contrasts sharply with a generally accepted correlation which has been identified between the gradual steady rise in reported rapes reported across the city since October 2017, and the timing of the origins of the #MeToo and subsequent #TimesUp movements.</p>

      <p>During a press conference on Oct. 3, 2018, Lori Pollock, Chief of Crime Control Strategies at the NYPD, said that September rape numbers, in general, were up from the previous month. Referring to domestic violent rape numbers, she said that prosecutions were being actively sought against perpetrators of domestic violence in possession of a gun or ammunition. “That’s a huge step towards keeping these people in prison and not increasing family violence,” she said.</p>

      <p>The NYPD confirm that rape numbers were indeed up to 144 for September 2018, versus 118 for August 2018, a jump of 24 percent. Chief Pollock said that 25 of the reported rape cases in September 2018 related to incidents which allegedly occurred prior to 2018, meaning that people who did not report at the time of an alleged incident were now beginning to come foreward and report. The NYPD and Mayor de Blasio concurred that victims of sexual violence may now feel supported by the global sense of sisterhood among women because of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements and as a result, feel more comfortable to report on historical rapes or other sexually violent incidents from their past.</p>

      <p>While prosecutions against perpetrators who are in possession of a gun or ammunition is welcomed, in other ways, it misses the point of domestic violence completely. Perpetrators of domestic violence do not need a gun or ammunition to cause injury. Physical brute force, without any weapon, is sufficient to cause serious bodily injury to another person. It can, of course, even cause death. Weapons and ammunition just make that task easier.</p>

      <h2>New Legislation</h2>

      <p>Additionally, how can Mayor de Blasio state, as he did on Oct. 3, 2018, that New York continues to be the safest big city in America when probably the majority of felonies are not taking place in the public sphere but behind closed doors and potentially grossly unreported?</p>


      <p>What most people fail to recognize when they talk about domestic violence is that often, victims cannot easily leave their partners, and historically, have stayed with them to raise the couple’s children because the victims have no financial income of their own. The mental trauma which victims have to endure in the aftermath of domestic violence, while knowing that they cannot leave, lasts a lifetime.</p>


      <p>The success of #MeToo and #TimesUp in the corporate media world, where top level media professionals like Bill O’Reilly, Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer, to name a few, have fallen from grace, led the movements’ members to broaden their focus to ordinary people who suffer sexual harassment and assault in the workplace on a daily basis but who do not have the voice or the resources to fight their harassers. The #TimesUp legal defense fund was specifically created to help those who could not afford to take their cases to the courts to do just that.</p>

      <p>However, as confirmed by Lindsey Pratt, a psychotherapist who specializes in sexual assault trauma, it is never easy for victims of sexual assault to proceed with prosecutions, despite having the financial resources available to them. It is particularly difficult to do so when the sexual abuse is being perpetrated by members of the same family or by those living within the same domestic arrangement as the victim.</p>


      <p>The process of reporting such crimes to police is further hampered by the fact that the majority of police officers serving in the Special Victims Unit are men. Up until recently, these NYPD officers and detectives had not necessarily been equipped to deal with sexual assault victims in the most compassionate manner. Pratt has spoken of police officers standing or leaning over seated victims while processing their cases, a stance which she says is uncomfortable and triggering for victims.</p>


      <p>On Oct. 31, New York City Council voted on a package of legislation aimed at improving the New York City Police Department’s interactions with sexual assault and harassment victims. The package includes sensitivity training for officers to help them deal with differences in culture, gender expression and sexual orientation and requires reports on staffing levels in the NYPD Special Victims Division. This move may improve the situation for victims but will take time to assess.</p>


      <p>War veterans are hailed as heroes when they return from war-torn countries and Americans wouldn’t dream of ever disrespecting them. Indeed, extraordinary focus is given to the process of rehabilitation of vets due to the broadly-recognized acceptance that they have survived the darkest and most terrifying situations, and are therefore in need of the nation's help in handling post-traumatic stress disorder. Indeed, terrorism is defined as the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

      For victims of domestic violence, they are also subjected to the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, but within the confines of their own home, potentially on a daily basis. Why, then, is the country not equally as concerned for victims of domestic violence, as it is for war veterans? At least the vets can escape the war, if they get out alive. Four of the twenty-seven murders reported in September 2018 by the NYPD related to domestic violence. For some, there will never be an escape from domestic terrorism, without the active intervention of the state.</p>

      <p>Chief Pollock confirmed that anyone who is affected by domestic violence or who knows of someone who is subjected to domestic violence can contact the NYPD discreetly on the following number:
