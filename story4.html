      <p>New York State Sheriff’s Association wants $12.8 million annually to fund substance abuse treatment programs in its prisons.
        The Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) estimates that close to 80% of incarcerated individuals are in need of substance use disorder treatment in the state prison system. Despite this number, Medication Assisted
        Treatment (MAT) programs are not widely available in state prisons.</p>

      <p>Patricia Herring’s son, Matthew, was 24 when he died from a drug overdose in August 2018, having been released from prison the previous June. Herring believes that had he been given access to MAT, while in prison, he might still be alive
        today.<p>

          <p>“The last time my very sick, unhealthy son entered into county jail for violating probation, he was caught with suboxone pills which he had hidden up his butt,” she said. “Do you know why he would attempt to sneak these pills in with
            him? Because he was petrified to go through opioid withdrawal without any medical assistance or medication.” Her son was subsequently placed in solitary confinement as punishment where he went through withdrawal alone.</p>

          <p>Herring delivered her comments in the State Assembly Room at 250, Broadway during a public hearing on the opioid crisis on Nov. 14. Representatives from the Assembly Standing Committees for Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, for Health, and for
            Correction listened to testimonies from 20 interested parties on the effectiveness of MAT programs in New York State’s penitentiaries.</p>

          <p>State Assembly Members, Linda Rosenthal and Richard Gottried, pressed Sean Byrne, Executive Deputy Commissioner from the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) and Anthony Annucci, Acting Commissioner, Department of
            Correctins and Community Supervision (DOCCS) as to why, given that every major medical, addiction, correctional, human rights, and public health organization in the US supports the use of MAT in correctional settings, it is not more
            widely available.</p>

          <p>MAT programs are currently only offered in six out of 54 state correctional facilities, which are Bedford Hills, Edgecombe, Hale Creek, Orleans, Willard Drug Treatment Campus and Queensboro.</p>

          <p>Member Gottfried drew applause from those present at the hearing when he compared the current lack of MAT in the remaining facilities to denying incarcerated individuals who are diabetic, their insulin.</p>

          <blockquote>
            "While security is an ever-present concern, given the potential for diversion of the medication, the lack of medical staff necessary to safely implement MAT is a major factor in why many jails do not offer this service."

        </p>Barry Virts, Sherrif of Wayne County and current president of the Sherrif’s Association</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>MAT FDA-approved medication</h2>

      <p>Byrne and Annucci agreed with the benefits of MAT and outlined the progress made to date since roughly 2015 when DOCCS and OASAS first started, what they called, "trial MAT programs" in limited facilities.
      </p>

      <p>Such MAT programs are offered via Opioid Treatment Programs or OTPs, whereby incarcerated individuals are taken out of prison on defined days for treatment at nearby medical facilities, which clearly requires a high degree of coordination
        and security.</p>

      <p>This is because the prisons in question do not have the appropriate license to administer the required medication on-site. There are also concerns around bringing such medication into prisons in order to curb security threats and possible
        contraband. They said one of the difficulties in expanding the program is the requirement for thorough coordination with outside support facilities, like hospitals, when prisoners are being transported out for treatment.</p>

      <p>They also said that When prisoners are transferred to new prisons, which happens frequently, this also requires further planning and coordination with the new prison and partner hospital or treatment center, in order to ensure the
        continuance of the affected prisoner's program.</p>

      <p>Despite these blocking points, Byrne and Annucci did commit to the further expansion of the program, which includes the use of FDA-approved medicines methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone in treating the addiction, in conjunction with
        appropriate counselling. They were unable to provide a clear timeframe however for full expansion.</p>

      <p>However, Michael Cannaday, Director of Treatment Services with the Osborne Association, was critical of the DOCCS and OASAS programs and said the limited programs in place to date are mostly available in short-term correctional facilities
        only, and that this fact skews success rates of the cited MAT programs. He said this was because short-term detainees are less likely to violate rules and stick to proposed programs, since their release is imminent. He said it is vital that
        such MAT programs are expanded to long-term facilities for long-term incarcerated individuals as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Barry Virts, Sherrif of Wayne County and current president of New York State's Sherrif’s Association said that even though the cost of the MAT medication itself may be reasonable, an estimated 12.8 million dollars is needed
        annually for the needed ancillary services that should come with it. This includes the cost of medically trained staff in prisons, as well as the cost of coordinating with outside community health services for incarcerated individuals,
        post-release, in order to curb relapse and potential overdose.</p>
