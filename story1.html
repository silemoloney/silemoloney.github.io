      <p>Local activists are urging New Yorkers to vote “No” on two proposals on the Nov. 6 ballot which they say will hamper the independence of local community boards on all matters, especially those relating to land use and re-zoning. </p>

      <p>Christopher LeBron, from Hell’s Kitchen, co-founded the committee to Vote No on NYC Charter Revision Proposals 2 and 3, in September. LeBron, 34, said, “community boards are the only check on executive powers that still exist in New York
        City.”</p>

      <p>Community board members are unpaid volunteers who serve two-year terms before they are either re-appointed or voted out. Their only powers are to make recommendations on community-related matters, including land use. In Hell’s Kitchen, their
        experience has been tested.</p>

      <p>LeBron said the proposed eight-year term limit on board members under Proposal 3 would create a knowledge gap on boards, which developers and lawyers would exploit during land use negotiations. “They’ve tried to do this before through
        legislation and failed. Many mayors have tried to do this, starting back in 2014,” he said.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Community boards are the only check on executive powers that still exist in New York City."
      </blockquote>

      <p>LeBron was speaking as a private citizen and committee co-founder since board members are prohibited, as public servants, from campaigning against the proposals. Some members of the Vote No Committee, including LeBron, are active board
        members.</p>

      <p>City Council member, Brad Lander, said term limits encourage diversity and youth onto community boards but LeBron said Proposal 3 is, “politicizing volunteerism and masking it as a progressive initiative.”</p>

      <p>He believes the term limits are reactionary measures taken against boards which have challenged the mayor on reneged land use promises. He cited a 2005-agreement worked out between CB4, the City Council, the borough president and then-Mayor
        Bloomberg for the Harborview development in Hell’s Kitchen to be used entirely for affordable housing.</p>

      <p>He said when Mayor de Blasio later over-turned that decision, opting instead to build a 50-story luxury condominium complex, and allocating less than 20% of the space for affordable housing, CB4 members challenged him. “He didn’t like that,
        so in response we received Proposal 3 which is term limits,” LeBron said. “Ostensibly, he’s just looking to get people out of the way so that he can develop at will.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Joe Restuccia, a Manhattan CB4 member, has spoken out as a private citizen against the proposed mayoral-controlled Civic Engagement Commission outlined under Proposal 2. Restuccia said the new commission would mean the mayor would
        control how community boards get funded or managed. He is also calling for a “No” vote on Proposals 2 and 3. “It’s a way to stifle response, cloaked in the idea of good government by making sure community boards don’t have long-term members,”
        he said. “It’s a very clear effort to say, community boards are kind of difficult to deal with and make the process difficult, so let’s make sure they’re not going to be as effective.”</p>

      <p>The mayor’s office did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
